# Node.js API Exercise

Welcome to our coding exercise! Some things to note:

* It's a Node.JS (20.12.2) app
* It uses a SQLite DB
* The app runs on port 3000

## Installation

Install Node if you don't already have it; you'll need at least version (20.12.2)

To start the app:
```sh
$ npm ci
$ npm run db:create
$ npm run db:populate
$ npm start
```

You can check it's working with `curl localhost:3000`

To run tests:
```sh
$ npm ci
$ npm run db:create:tests
$ npm test
```

## Coding Exercise Instructions

We want to launch a new feature that lets users get informed about what recently happened. We are building a Petitions newsfeed. As part of the team, youâ€™ll contribute to the delivery of this feature: a Petitions newsfeed. **We are asking you to build the back-end to support this feature.** A newsfeed is a timeline of multiple events that happened and that you might be interested in.

Our Newsfeed will display:
- Latest 3 created petitions
- Latest petitions that are created from your network (petition starters you follow)

Here are the details of the API endpoints you will work on:
**Recent petitions**
- `/petitions` is provided
- currently returns all petitions
- you will need to modify to return the 3 most recently created petitions from the past week

**Personalized petitions**
- you will need to build this endpoint
- it should return a list of petitions from starters that you follow ordered by most recently updated


### Evaluation Criteria
- JavaScript/Node best practices
- Completeness: Did you include all features?
- Readability: Is the solution written in a clean way so others can understand?
- Testing: Has the solution been adequately tested?

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the main branch. After you have pushed your code, you must submit the assignment via the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,
